###Flask Tools Survey Exercise

<ul> Completed steps:
<li>1</li>
<li>2</li>
<li>3</li>
<li>4</li>
<li>5</li>
<li>6 - was unable to complete, I reviewed solution, looks like a clever way to use the length of RESPONSES as the index of question to visit, spent a lot of time on this already, would be a good chat with mentor, unfortunately I don't have access to a mentor at the moment</li>
<li>7 - unable to complete step 7, linked to step 6, I feel comfy with flash messages, somewhat anyways I can make them work, but trouble with putting into practice in this context</li>
<li>8 - will complete after I complete the session module</li>

</ul>
